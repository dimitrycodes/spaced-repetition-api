# Spaced repetition Learning API!

Space repetition learning enables you to learn a new language and retain the information at a higher rate. 
To begin the person learing starts with a new word and the more often that the word is correctly guessed, the less they see that word and if they happen to guess a word incorrectly then the more often they will see the word to help them master it. This client app use conditional rending to show scores, results of guesses, and correct translation. The server-side uses a linked-list. 

Stack This app was created using: Node, Express, Git, Javascript, Heroku


## Local dev setup

If using user `dunder-mifflin`:

```bash
mv example.env .env
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition-test
```

If your `dunder-mifflin` user has a password be sure to set it in `.env` for all appropriate fields. Or if using a different user, update appropriately.

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
env MIGRATION_DB_NAME=spaced-repetition-test npm run migrate
```

And `npm test` should work at this point

## Configuring Postgres

For tests involving time to run properly, configure your Postgres database to run in the UTC timezone.

1. Locate the `postgresql.conf` file for your Postgres installation.
   1. E.g. for an OS X, Homebrew install: `/usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`
   2. E.g. on Windows, _maybe_: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11.2\data\postgresql.conf`
   3. E.g  on Ubuntu 18.04 probably: '/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf'
2. Find the `timezone` line and set it to `UTC`:

```conf
# - Locale and Formatting -

datestyle = 'iso, mdy'
#intervalstyle = 'postgres'
timezone = 'UTC'
#timezone_abbreviations = 'Default'     # Select the set of available time zone
```
